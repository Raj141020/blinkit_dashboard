# blinkit Power BI Project

## Overview

This project showcases the creation of a dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard for analyzing sales data from an online grocery store, Blinket. The aim is to provide valuable insights into the store's performance through data visualization, starting from requirement gathering to data cleaning and visualization.

## Project Highlights

- **Interactive Dashboard**: The dashboard analyzes data from Blinkit, an online grocery shopping application, featuring dynamic filters and key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, average sales, number of items sold, and average ratings.
- **Data Handling**: The project involves detailed steps, including gathering business requirements, data cleaning, and modeling, to create insightful charts and a well-formatted dashboard.

## Steps Involved

### 1. Requirement Gathering and Data Preparation

- Acted as the customer to provide specifications for the dashboard.
- Reviewed raw data for size and structure, ensuring data quality through thorough checks.
- Performed data cleaning and modeling, incorporating necessary calculations and formatting.

### 2. Understanding Item Identifiers and Types

- Identified unique item codes for products, including various types such as snacks, beverages, and household items.
- Collected outlet information, including establishment year, location tier, and size classification.

### 3. Data Quality Checks

- Used Power Query to ensure data types were converted correctly and automatically.
- Verified column quality to maintain 100% validity, investigating any errors or null values exceeding acceptable limits.
